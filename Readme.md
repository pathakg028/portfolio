A server hosts information. An IP address is associated with that server. A DNS points you towards the IP address the server is on. AN ISP provides a gateway to the rest of the internet, that the DNS server is in charge of directing. A Browser communicates with your devices’ network access chip, and then to the ISP. A user creates information or accesses information through this browser.

# introduction

A junior developer, I originally studied Mtech (Information Technology) from Swinburne universities Melbourne. 
I worked in a Digital Agency (APD) as a Traffic Executive.

I am very fond of learning new things specially web development. So I have shifted my focus toward 
transitioning into a career in full-stack web development. I am currently undertaking the Coder Academy Bootcamp at the Academy of Information Technology. 
I'm always looking to explore new opportunities and work with passionate, creative people.
