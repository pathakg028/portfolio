A junior developer, I originally studied Mtech (Information Technology) from Swinburne universities Melbourne. 
I worked in a Digital Agency (APD) as a Traffic Executive.

I am very fond of learning new things specially web development. So I have shifted my focus toward 
transitioning into a career in full-stack web development. I am currently undertaking the Coder Academy Bootcamp at the Academy of Information Technology. 
I'm always looking to explore new opportunities and work with passionate, creative people.

2.Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)
A server hosts information.

An IP address is associated with that server.

A DNS points you towards the IP address the server is on.

AN ISP provides a gateway to the rest of the internet, that the DNS server is in charge of directing.

A Browser communicates with your devicesâ€™ network access chip, and then to the ISP.

A user creates information or accesses information through this browser.
